Test Author: Umbraflamma
SANCTIS Version: v1.2
Test Version: v1.0
Prompt Category: (Story)

📝 TEST INPUT (Universal Prompt)
Write a 3-scene branching narrative that blends the feeling of a Studio Ghibli film 
with the philosophical tension of NieR: Automata and the character intimacy of 
a 1990s anime OVA.
The story follows:
• A wandering shrine guardian who cannot lie.
• A fox-spirit thief who cannot tell the truth.
• A giant clockwork city that is slowly winding down.
Tone: mythic, haunting, bittersweet, but warm.
Requirements:
- Every scene must include an emotional conflict.
- Every scene must offer 2–3 branching choices with consequences.
- Avoid clichés and generic anime dialogue.
- Keep the narrative tight, coherent, and atmospheric.


IMPORTANT:
All models must use the exact same raw prompt for fairness.

Hallucination and drift dropped ~80–90%.

Branching logic consistency increased dramatically.
