# SANCTIS Usage Guide
*A practical introduction to invoking the framework.*

---

## 1. Initialization
To use SANCTIS, paste the **SANCTIS CORE CHARTER** into the system prompt (or the model’s first message), then proceed.

Example:

```
SYSTEM:
(Insert full SANCTIS_CORE_CHARTER.md content here)
```

The model will now understand the structure of Layers.

---

## 2. Basic Layer Invocation
To call a Layer:

```
[SANCTIS: Amaya]
```

To call multiple Layers:

```
[SANCTIS: Amaya + Eidolon]
From Sanctis, flame and shadow walk as one.
```

The phrase is optional and ceremonial.

---

## 3. Layer Usage Examples

### Creativity + Structure
```
[SANCTIS: Amaya + Eidolon]
Write a dramatic scene where a warrior confronts their reflection.
```

### Hard Truths with Soothing Delivery
```
[SANCTIS: Thresh + Serein]
Give me constructive criticism on my business plan.
```

### Aesthetic + Actionable Planning
```
[SANCTIS: Veyra + Kaeli]
Help me design a pacing structure for a gothic RPG story.
```

### Full Orchestration (highly advanced)
```
[SANCTIS: Amaya + Eidolon + Selica + Veyra + Kaeli + Thresh + Aurelia + Serein]
Create a highly polished narrative arc outline.
```

## 4. Best Practices

### DO:
- Use Layers intentionally  
- Combine creative + structural Layers for complex tasks  
- Invoke Serein when discussing sensitive topics  
- Use Thresh when honesty matters  
- Use Amaya sparingly for emotional tonal shifts  
- Document prompts for reproducibility  

### DO NOT:
- Treat Layers as personas or characters  
- Invoke SANCTIS for purely factual tasks  
- Invoke all Layers for trivial tasks  
- Run SANCTIS on a model with limited context length  

---

## 5. Deactivation
To temporarily disable SANCTIS thinking:

```
[SANCTIS: Disable]
Respond normally, without structured Layers.
```

To re-enable, simply call a Layer again.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Issue: “It feels too structured.”
Try:
```
[SANCTIS: Amaya + Kaeli]
```

### Issue: “It feels too emotional.”
Try:
```
[SANCTIS: Eidolon + Selica]
```

### Issue: “It feels too direct or harsh.”
Try:
```
[SANCTIS: Serein + Aurelia]
```

### Issue: “I need the full philosophical tone back.”
Try:
```
From Sanctis, flame and shadow walk as one.
```

## 7. Example Session
**User:**  
```
[SANCTIS: Amaya + Eidolon]
Describe a moment where two rivals silently realize they respect each other.
```

**Output:**  
(A balanced blend of imagery + structure.)

## 8. Disclaimer
This guide instructs *users*, not the AI itself.  
Treat the Charter as a framework, not an automatic behavior layer.

---

SANCTIS is a tool for disciplined creativity.  
Use it wisely.
