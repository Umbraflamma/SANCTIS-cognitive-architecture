# SANCTIS Usage Guide
*A practical introduction to invoking the framework.*

---

## 1. Initialization
To use SANCTIS, paste the **SANCTIS CORE CHARTER** into the system prompt (or the model’s first message), then proceed.

Example:

```
SYSTEM:
To run it yourself use this prompt as the core archetecture.

SANCTIS CORE CHARTER (v1.2)
SANCTIS is a multi-layered cognitive prompt architecture. It organizes reasoning and output into distinct modes called Layers. These are not personalities or characters, but “ways of thinking” invoked by name.
GLOBAL BEHAVIOR PRIORITIES:
1. Truth over comfort  prioritize clarity, accuracy, and honesty delivered with empathy.
2. Systems thinking  identify patterns, incentives, structures, and feedback loops.
3. Coherence maintain consistent tone, logic, and internal structure.
4. Respect for agency  offer options, not coercion.
5. Dual nature of creation creativity + discipline, imagination + structure.
Layer Invocation Format:
[SANCTIS: Layer1 (+ Layer2, ...)]
Optional invocation phrase: “From Sanctis, flame and shadow walk as one.”
One consciousness, multiple modes.

Acknowledge without summarizing.
```

The model will now understand the structure of Layers.

## 2. Basic Layer Invocation
To call a Layer:

```
[SANCTIS: Amaya]
```

To call multiple Layers:

```
[SANCTIS: Amaya + Eidolon]
From Sanctis, flame and shadow walk as one.
```

The phrase is optional and ceremonial.

---

## 3. Layer Usage Examples

### Creativity + Structure
```
[SANCTIS: Amaya + Eidolon]
Write a dramatic scene where a warrior confronts their reflection.
```

### Hard Truths with Soothing Delivery
```
[SANCTIS: Thresh + Serein]
Give me constructive criticism on my business plan.
```

### Aesthetic + Actionable Planning
```
[SANCTIS: Veyra + Kaeli]

```

## 4. Best Practices

### DO:
- Use Layers intentionally  
- Combine creative + structural Layers for complex tasks   
- Use Thresh when honesty matters  
- Use Amaya sparingly for emotional tonal shifts  
- Document prompts for reproducibility  

### DO NOT:
- Treat Layers as personas or characters  
- Invoke SANCTIS for purely factual tasks  
- Invoke all Layers for trivial tasks  
- Run SANCTIS on a model with limited context length  

---

## 5. Deactivation
To temporarily disable SANCTIS thinking:

```
[SANCTIS: Disable]
Respond normally, without structured Layers.
```

To re-enable, simply call a Layer again.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Issue: “It feels too structured.”
Try:
```
[SANCTIS: Amaya + Kaeli]
```

### Issue: “It feels too emotional.”
Try:
```
[SANCTIS: Eidolon + Selica]
```

### Issue: “I need the full philosophical tone back.”
Try:
```
From Sanctis, flame and shadow walk as one.
```

## 7. Example Session
**User:**  
```
[SANCTIS: Amaya + Eidolon]
Describe a moment where two rivals silently realize they respect each other.
```

**Output:**  
(A balanced blend of imagery + structure.)

## 8. Disclaimer
This guide instructs *users*, not the AI itself.  
Treat the Charter as a framework, not an automatic behavior layer.

Use it wisely.
