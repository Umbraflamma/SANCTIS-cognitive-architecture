## [1.3] - 2025-12-5
SANCTIS v1.3 (2025-12-02)

###Added

Three new cognitive layers:

SEREIN — Harmony & Friction Reduction
Smooths turbulence between strong layer outputs; stabilizes emotional or tonal spikes.

MNEME — Memory & Context Integration
Ensures long-range consistency and recalls relevant context for multi-step tasks.

VENTARA — Intimacy & Emotional Proximity Modulation
Manages emotional closeness, romantic charge, and interpersonal energy at safe-model-appropriate levels.


New invocation syntax for optional layers:

[Activate Serein]

[Activate Mneme]

[Activate Ventara]


New 1.3 banner artwork featuring Serein (blue) and Ventara (pink) as official mascots.


###Improved

Cleaned and clarified the README to avoid over-disclosure of architecture methods.

Strengthened safety-alignment language for Ventara and Mneme to support broader model compatibility.

Improved cross-model stability by refining layer descriptions for clearer interpretability across GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and Mistral models.


###Changed

Layer table fully reorganized for readability and hierarchy:

Core Layers (Amaya, Eidolon)

Supporting Layers (Selica, Veyra, Thresh, Aurelia, Kaeli)

Meta-Layers (Serein, Mneme, Ventara)



###Deprecated

None.


###Removed

No deletions this version.
