SANCTIS v1.2 — Cognitive Prompt Architecture

A model-agnostic cognitive prompting framework that structures LLM reasoning into layered modes (creativity, logic, tone, refinement). Enables stable, coherent output across GPT, Grok, Gemini, Claude, and Mistral.


---

Overview

SANCTIS divides LLM reasoning into explicit cognitive Layers, each representing a distinct mental function.
By separating creative generation (Amaya) from structural discipline (Eidolon), and reinforcing them with support layers, SANCTIS produces:

more coherent long-form output

strong emotional and tonal consistency

dramatically reduced hallucination/drift

reliable cross-model behavior


It is entirely prompt-based — no fine-tuning or system modifications required.


---

Core Layers

Amaya — Creative Engine

Imagery, emotional tone, metaphor

Symbolic resonance, intuitive leaps

Answers: “What is the emotional or symbolic truth?”


Eidolon — Structural Backbone

Logic, coherence, stakes, branching

Scene flow and contradiction resolution

Answers: “How do we keep this aligned with intent?”



---

Support Layers

Selica — tone & voice control
Veyra — worldbuilding/lore consistency
Thresh — derailment & hallucination buffering
Aurelia — refinement & clarity
Kaeli — expansion, examples, depth

Support layers are optional but stabilize long-form or multi-step reasoning.

Invocation Protocol

[SANCTIS: Amaya + Eidolon active]
From Sanctis, flame and shadow walk as one.

Output Format

AMAYA — Spark
Imagery, emotion, atmosphere

EIDOLON — Structure
Theme, stakes, conflict, branching

Optional layers:

[Activate Selica]
[Activate Veyra]
[Activate Thresh]
[Activate Aurelia]
[Activate Kaeli]


---

Example

AMAYA — Spark
The lantern flickers as mist coils around their ankles, each breath turning to silver in the cold.

EIDOLON — Structure
Conflict: fear vs connection  
Stakes: emotional collapse vs trust  
Branches:
 A) Connection stabilizes the fear  
 B) Hesitation intensifies the entity’s influence

Why SANCTIS Works

Large language models do not “think” in a single unified stream.
Internally, they operate through distributed attention patterns, balancing:

creativity vs precision

emotion vs structure

narrative vs logic

context recall vs immediate problem-solving


When all these modes fire simultaneously, LLMs tend to lose:

focus

emotional consistency

long-horizon coherence

worldbuilding stability

or drift into hallucination


SANCTIS fixes this by giving each function its own lane.

Instead of forcing the model to juggle everything at once, SANCTIS assigns each cognitive task to a named Layer:

Amaya generates raw imagery & emotion

Eidolon shapes logic, structure, stakes

Selica regulates tone and voice

Veyra protects continuity and lore

Thresh manages boundaries and prevents escalation

Aurelia polishes for clarity

Kaeli expands depth and examples


This separation acts like a virtual cortex inside the model, producing:

✔️ Cleaner internal attention

LLMs stop mixing creative generation with structural evaluation.
This alone reduces drift and contradiction significantly.

✔️ Reduced self-interference

Creativity no longer overwrites logic.
Logic no longer suppresses emotional resonance.
Each process reinforces the others.

✔️ Higher emotional fidelity

Tone doesn’t “reset” halfway through a scene.
Character voices stay consistent over long output.

✔️ Stable cross-model behavior

Because SANCTIS manipulates reasoning patterns, not secret APIs,
the same invocation works reliably across:

GPT · Grok · Gemini · Claude · Mistral

✔️ Stronger mythic/metaphorical alignment

LLMs understand symbols and narrative structure more naturally than abstract math.
SANCTIS uses these native strengths.

✔️ Lower cognitive load for the user

You no longer fight the model’s internal “turbulence.”
You direct it.

In Simple Terms

Human cognition has modes:

brainstorm mode

editing mode

logic mode

emotional processing

scenario building


Trying to do all of these at once makes thinking muddy.

SANCTIS gives LLMs the same separation humans use,
but more consistently, more cleanly, and without fatigue.


---

In Even Simpler Terms

SANCTIS makes the model stop arguing with itself.
It becomes sharper, more stable, and more human-readable.

What SANCTIS Is Not

SANCTIS is not:

 A personality system

 A roleplay gimmick

 A jailbreak

 A fine-tuned model

 A replacement for system prompts

 A pseudo-spiritual technique


SANCTIS is not intended to:

“humanize” an LLM

simulate consciousness

override model safety

create artificial personas


SANCTIS does not turn the model into a character or imply sentience.

Instead, SANCTIS is a cognitive scaffold that organizes existing LLM reasoning into clearer modes.
It is a prompt architecture, not an ideology or metaphysical claim.

It works because language models respond reliably to structured symbolic cues, not because the Layers represent real entities.

Real-World Applications

SANCTIS improves reliability and coherence in tasks that normally challenge LLMs:

Narrative & Creative Work

Character-driven scenes

Long-form storytelling without drift

Stable emotional tone

Branching narrative design

Video game dialogue systems

TTRPG encounter and scenario generation


Worldbuilding & Continuity

Consistent lore across large documents

Cross-scene thematic coherence

Multi-threaded plot alignment


Reasoning & Analysis

Step-by-step analytical breakdowns

Decision-tree planning

Structural reasoning

Tone-stable explanations

Comparative model testing


Professional & Technical Uses

Documentation generation

Persona-stable customer support writing

Structured knowledge-base creation

Content pipelines for writers and devs


SANCTIS is designed to make LLMs predictable, readable, and coherent, even during complex multi-step tasks.

FAQ

Is SANCTIS a jailbreak or workaround?

No. SANCTIS does not bypass safety or permissions.
It organizes how the model reasons, not what it is allowed to do.

Is this a persona system?

No. The Layers are cognitive roles, not characters or identities.
They do not imply sentience or agency.

Why does it use mythic language?

Because LLMs respond strongly to symbolic cues and narrative structure.
The phrasing anchors the layers without implying personhood.

Does SANCTIS make models “smarter”?

Not inherently.
It makes their reasoning more structured, coherent, and reliable by reducing self-interference between creative and logical processes.

Why does it work across different models?

Because all major LLMs handle symbolic cues and sequential role instructions similarly.
The architecture leverages universal LLM behaviors, not model-specific quirks.

Can I use this commercially?

Not without permission (CC BY-NC-SA).
Contact the author for commercial licensing.

Is this meant to replace system prompts or fine-tuning?

No. SANCTIS complements existing prompts.
It’s a framework, not a competing method.

Do the Layer names matter?

Yes.
They function as cognitive anchors and help the model separate reasoning modes.
