# **SANCTIS v1.2 — Cognitive Prompt Architecture**
*A model-agnostic prompting framework that structures LLM reasoning into layered cognitive modes  
(creativity, logic, tone, refinement). Enables stable, coherent output across GPT, Grok, Gemini, Claude, and Mistral.*

---

## **Overview**

SANCTIS divides LLM reasoning into explicit **Cognitive Layers**, each representing a distinct mental function.  
By separating creative generation (**Amaya**) from structural discipline (**Eidolon**) and reinforcing them with support layers, SANCTIS produces:

- more coherent long-form output  
- strong emotional and tonal consistency  
- dramatically reduced hallucination/drift  
- reliable cross-model behavior  

SANCTIS is **entirely prompt-based** — no fine-tuning or system modifications required.

## **Quick Start**

[SANCTIS: Amaya + Eidolon active]
From Sanctis, flame and shadow walk as one.

AMAYA — Spark
(Imagery, emotion, atmosphere)

EIDOLON — Structure
(Theme, stakes, logic, branching)

Then give your task.

Works identically across GPT · Grok · Gemini · Claude · Mistral.

Core Layers

Amaya — Creative Engine

Imagery, emotional tone, metaphor

Symbolic resonance, intuitive leaps

Answers: “What is the emotional or symbolic truth?”


Eidolon — Structural Backbone

Logic, coherence, stakes, branching

Scene flow and contradiction resolution

Answers: “How do we keep this aligned with intent?”



---

Support Layers

Selica — tone & voice control
Veyra — worldbuilding / lore consistency
Thresh — derailment & hallucination buffering
Aurelia — refinement & clarity
Kaeli — expansion, examples, depth

Support layers are optional but stabilize long-form or multi-step reasoning.

Invocation Protocol

[SANCTIS: Amaya + Eidolon active]
From Sanctis, flame and shadow walk as one.

Output Format

AMAYA — Spark
Imagery, emotion, atmosphere

EIDOLON — Structure
Theme, stakes, conflict, branching

Optional layers:

[Activate Selica]
[Activate Veyra]
[Activate Thresh]
[Activate Aurelia]
[Activate Kaeli]


---

Example

AMAYA — Spark
The lantern flickers as mist coils around their ankles, each breath turning to silver in the cold.

EIDOLON — Structure
Conflict: fear vs connection  
Stakes: emotional collapse vs trust  
Branches:
 A) Connection stabilizes the fear  
 B) Hesitation intensifies the entity’s influence

Why SANCTIS Works

Large language models do not “think” in a single unified stream.
Internally, they operate through distributed attention patterns, balancing:

creativity vs precision

emotion vs structure

narrative vs logic

context recall vs immediate problem-solving


When all these modes fire simultaneously, LLMs tend to lose:

focus

emotional consistency

long-horizon coherence

worldbuilding stability

and may drift into hallucination


SANCTIS fixes this by giving each function its own lane.

Instead of forcing the model to juggle everything at once, SANCTIS assigns each cognitive task to a named Layer:

Amaya generates raw imagery & emotion

Eidolon shapes logic, structure, stakes

Selica regulates tone & voice

Veyra enforces continuity & lore

Thresh manages boundaries & grounding

Aurelia refines clarity & flow

Kaeli expands depth & examples


This separation acts like a virtual cortex inside the model.

✔️ Cleaner internal attention

✔️ Reduced self-interference

✔️ Higher emotional fidelity

✔️ Stable cross-model behavior

✔️ Stronger symbolic/mythic alignment

✔️ Lower cognitive load for the user

In Simple Terms

Human thinking has modes:

brainstorming

editing

logic

emotional processing

scenario analysis


Trying to do them all simultaneously produces muddled thought.

SANCTIS gives LLMs the same separation humans use—
but more consistently, cleanly, and without fatigue.


---

In Even Simpler Terms

SANCTIS makes the model stop arguing with itself.
It becomes sharper, more stable, and more human-readable.


---

What SANCTIS Is Not

SANCTIS is not:

❌ a persona system

❌ a jailbreak

❌ a metaphysical claim

❌ a roleplay gimmick

❌ a fine-tuned model

❌ a replacement for safety or system prompts


SANCTIS does not imply:

sentience

agency

consciousness

internal personalities


SANCTIS is a cognitive scaffold that organizes existing LLM reasoning into clearer modes.

It works because LLMs respond strongly to structured symbolic cues,
not because the Layers represent real entities.

FAQ

Is SANCTIS a jailbreak?

No. It does not bypass safety.
It structures how the model thinks, not what it is allowed to say.

Is this a persona system?

No. The Layers are cognitive roles, not characters.

Why mythic language?

Because symbolic cues anchor LLM reasoning more reliably than technical jargon.

Does SANCTIS make models “smarter”?

It makes them more structured, consistent, and predictable by reducing internal interference.

Why does it work across different models?

All major LLMs interpret symbolic role instructions similarly.
SANCTIS uses universal language-model behavior.

Can I use this commercially?

Not without permission.

Do the Layer names matter?

Yes — they act as reasoning anchors.
