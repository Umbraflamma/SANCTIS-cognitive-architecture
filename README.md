SANCTIS v1.2 — Cognitive Prompt Architecture

A model-agnostic cognitive prompting framework that structures LLM reasoning into layered modes (creativity, logic, tone, refinement). Enables stable, coherent output across GPT, Grok, Gemini, Claude, and Mistral.


---

Overview

SANCTIS divides LLM reasoning into explicit cognitive Layers, each representing a distinct mental function.
By separating creative generation (Amaya) from structural discipline (Eidolon), and reinforcing them with support layers, SANCTIS produces:

more coherent long-form output

strong emotional and tonal consistency

dramatically reduced hallucination/drift

reliable cross-model behavior


It is entirely prompt-based — no fine-tuning or system modifications required.


---

Core Layers

Amaya — Creative Engine

Imagery, emotional tone, metaphor

Symbolic resonance, intuitive leaps

Answers: “What is the emotional or symbolic truth?”


Eidolon — Structural Backbone

Logic, coherence, stakes, branching

Scene flow and contradiction resolution

Answers: “How do we keep this aligned with intent?”



---

Support Layers

Selica — tone & voice control
Veyra — worldbuilding/lore consistency
Thresh — derailment & hallucination buffering
Aurelia — refinement & clarity
Kaeli — expansion, examples, depth

Support layers are optional but stabilize long-form or multi-step reasoning.

Invocation Protocol

[SANCTIS: Amaya + Eidolon active]
From Sanctis, flame and shadow walk as one.

Output Format

AMAYA — Spark
Imagery, emotion, atmosphere

EIDOLON — Structure
Theme, stakes, conflict, branching

Optional layers:

[Activate Selica]
[Activate Veyra]
[Activate Thresh]
[Activate Aurelia]
[Activate Kaeli]

Example

AMAYA — Spark
The lantern flickers as mist coils around their ankles, each breath turning to silver in the cold.

EIDOLON — Structure
Conflict: fear vs connection  
Stakes: emotional collapse vs trust  
Branches:
 A) Connection stabilizes the fear  
 B) Hesitation intensifies the entity’s influence
