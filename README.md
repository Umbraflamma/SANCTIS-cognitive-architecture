# SANCTIS-cognitive-architecture
A model-agnostic cognitive prompt architecture that structures LLM reasoning into layered modes (creativity, logic, tone, refinement). Enables stable, coherent output across GPT, Grok, Gemini, Claude, and Mistral.
# Sanctis v1.2 – Cognitive Prompt Architecture
A modular, model-agnostic prompting framework for structured, coherent AI reasoning.

## Overview
Sanctis divides LLM reasoning into explicit cognitive layers. Each layer represents a mental function such as creativity (Amaya) or structural discipline (Eidolon). By separating these processes, Sanctis creates consistent, stable output across GPT, Grok, Gemini, Claude, and Mistral.

## Core Layers
### Amaya – Creative Engine
- Imagery, emotional tone, metaphor
- Answers: “What is the emotional truth?”

### Eidolon – Structural Backbone
- Logic, stakes, branches, coherence
- Answers: “How do we keep this aligned with intent?”

## Support Layers
- **Selica** – tone & voice control  
- **Veyra** – worldbuilding/lore consistency  
- **Thresh** – derailment & hallucination buffering  
- **Aurelia** – refinement & clarity  
- **Kaeli** – expansion & depth  

## Invocation Protocol


[SANCTIS: Amaya + Eidolon active]
 From Sanctis, flame and shadow walk as one.

Output Format:


AMAYA: Spark
(Imagery, emotion, atmosphere)
EIDOLON: Structure
(Theme, stakes, conflict, branching)

Optional layers:


[Activate Selica]
 [Activate Veyra]
 [Activate Thresh]
 [Activate Aurelia]
 [Activate Kaeli]

## Example


AMAYA: Spark
The lantern flickers as mist coils around their ankles…
EIDOLON: Structure
Conflict: fear vs connection
 Stakes: emotional collapse vs trust
 Branches:
 A) Connection stabilizes the fear
 B) Hesitation intensifies entity influence
